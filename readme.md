# My First API with Express and MongoDB

Welcome to the repository of my first API! In this project, I have developed a simple API using the Express framework, MongoDB database with Mongoose library, and Node.js.

## Description

This API was created with the goal of learning the basic concepts of building RESTful APIs using Express and MongoDB. It provides endpoints to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on a MongoDB database, allowing the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of resources.

## Technologies Used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Server-side development platform.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Node.js framework for building web applications and RESTful APIs.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): NoSQL database.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/): Object Data Modeling (ODM) for MongoDB in Node.js.
